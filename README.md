## 🧠 What is shellfu?

`shellfu` is a collection of tiny, helpful shell scripts you can load into your terminal session to:

* ⚡ Boost your productivity with custom commands
* 🧰 Organize your personal shell tools
* ✨ Keep your config clean, modular, and version-controlled

It’s **plug-and-play**, minimal, and easy to extend:

* Just drop `.sh` files into `~/.shellfu/scripts/`
* They'll be auto-loaded every time you start a shell
* No extra dependencies, just bash/zsh

## 📁 Script organization

Scripts are grouped by purpose:

```txt
scripts/
├── git-utils.sh       # Shortcuts & helpers for Git
├── sys-monitor.sh     # Disk/mem usage helpers
├── dev-env.sh         # Functions for dev workflows
└── custom.sh          # Your own stuff goes here
```
